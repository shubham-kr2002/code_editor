## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- npm or yarn

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/code-editor.git
   cd code-editor
   ```

2. Install frontend dependencies:
   ```
   cd client
   npm install
   ```

3. Install backend dependencies:
   ```
   cd ../server
   npm install
   ```

4. Create a `.env` file in the server directory:
   ```
   PORT=5000
   JUDGE0_API=https://judge0-ce.p.rapidapi.com
   JUDGE0_KEY=your_judge0_api_key
   ```

   Get a Judge0 API key from [RapidAPI](https://rapidapi.com/judge0-official/api/judge0-ce).

### Running the Application

1. Start the backend server:
   ```
   cd server
   npm run dev
   ```

2. Start the frontend development server:
   ```
   cd client
   npm run dev
   ```

3. Open your browser and navigate to:
   ```
   http://localhost:5173
   ```

## Deployment

### Frontend

Build the frontend for production:
```
cd client
npm run build
```

The build files will be in the `client/dist` directory.

### Backend

For production deployment, use a process manager like PM2:
```
npm install -g pm2
cd server
pm2 start src/index.js --name code-editor-backend
```

## Running with Docker

You can run the entire project using Docker Compose. This setup uses Node.js version 22.13.1 (slim) for both the frontend and backend services, as specified in the Dockerfiles.

### Requirements

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) installed on your system.
- A `.env` file in the `server/` directory with the following variables:
  ```
  PORT=5000
  JUDGE0_API=https://judge0-ce.p.rapidapi.com
  JUDGE0_KEY=your_judge0_api_key
  ```
  (See `server/README.md` for more details.)

### Build and Run

From the project root directory, run:
```
docker compose up --build
```
This will build and start both the frontend and backend services.

### Services and Ports

- **Frontend (js-client):**
  - Runs the Vite preview server
  - Exposes port `4173` (accessible at `http://localhost:4173`)
- **Backend (js-server):**
  - Runs the Node.js backend server
  - Exposes port `5000` (accessible at `http://localhost:5000`)

### Notes

- The backend service depends on the `.env` file for API keys and configuration.
- Both services run as non-root users for improved security.
- The containers are connected via a custom Docker network (`app-network`).
