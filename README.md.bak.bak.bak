## Running with Docker

You can run the entire project using Docker Compose. This setup uses Node.js version 22.13.1 (slim) for both the frontend and backend services, as specified in the Dockerfiles.

### Requirements

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) installed on your system.
- A `.env` file in the `server/` directory with the following variables:
  ```
  PORT=5000
  JUDGE0_API=https://judge0-ce.p.rapidapi.com
  JUDGE0_KEY=your_judge0_api_key
  ```
  (See `server/README.md` for more details.)

### Build and Run

From the project root directory, run:
```
docker compose up --build
```
This will build and start both the frontend and backend services.

### Services and Ports

- **Frontend (js-client):**
  - Runs the Vite preview server
  - Exposes port `4173` (accessible at `http://localhost:4173`)
- **Backend (js-server):**
  - Runs the Node.js backend server
  - Exposes port `5000` (accessible at `http://localhost:5000`)

### Notes

- The backend service depends on the `.env` file for API keys and configuration.
- Both services run as non-root users for improved security.
- The containers are connected via a custom Docker network (`app-network`).
